		<p>People laugh at the idea of an expensive keyboard. “You can just buy one for ten bucks at target, why pay that much more money?” “I could 
buy a laptop for those prices, with one already included” “who needs those things anyway,” We’ve heard it all. A keyboard, such an ordinary thing in our lives.
 Log on to your computer, search up silly things on the web, finish that history assignment that was due last week, you name it. The average American spends 
at least three hours typing each day, which adds up to over 1,000 hours typing a year. </p>

		We buy the materials:</p>
		
		<!--Materials List-->

		<ul>
			<li><span class="fancy-words">The base</span> is the bottom of the keybard, and is what holds all the keys in place and determines the sizing of the keyboard. They can come in a variety of different colors, sizes, and materials.</li>
			<li><span class="fancy-words">The PCB</span> is the electronics inside of the keyboard.</li>
			<li><span class="fancy-words">The plate</span> is the part which mounts the switches and plays a big role in the pitch of the board, and how stiff or soft it is.<br> </li>
			<li><span class="fancy-words">The switches</span> determine the spring feel such as the bump, smoothness, and weight of the springs.</li>
			<li><span class="fancy-words">The stabilizers</span> go on all keys bigger than two units wide, they keep away the unwanted "key wobble" which slows down typing speed and creates a clattering sound.</li>
			<li><span class="fancy-words">The keycaps</span> are the visible buttons on top of the board, which go right above the switches. The keycaps determine the sound and color of the keys.</li>
			<li><span class="fancy-words">Lube</span> smoothes down the keypress for tactile switches. A regular keyboard typically uses 2-3 different kinds of lube.</li>
			<li><span class="fancy-words">Foam</span> is used to dampen the sound of the keyboard, and reduces hollow sound from keypress.</li>
			<li><span class="fancy-words">A soldering iron</span> is a tool that may be needed for switch attatchment, depending on the PCB of the keyoard.</li>
			<li><span class="fancy-words">Films</span> are small plastic foam squares that are wedged between the top and bottom of a switch to reduce wobble and alter sound in the keys.</li>
        	</ul>
 		

 	
		<p>
		After the materials are gathered, the keyboard is assembled. This may take anywhere between four and fifteen hours, depending on the size and layout of the board.
